# Beginner-Churn-Data

The data was provided by the user Ritika Saini on the website Kaggle. You can find the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritikasaini/telecom-churn?

This project I worked on uses the telecom customer dataset to predict churn data using logistic regression.

Regarding some information about this:
This features engineering on numeric variables.
An accuracy of 78.7%
Binary classification of churn using scikit-learn.

The code outputs a classification report, confusion matrix heat map, and a bar chart showing churn vs no churn.

To run this, you will need the following libraries:
pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Then you can run  Churn Project.py
